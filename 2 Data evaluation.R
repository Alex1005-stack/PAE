  # VOX piece as basis for rough assumption: https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/11/2/18049510/felon-voting-rights-amendment-4-florida
  # Crist restored the right to vote to about 150,000 ex-felons convicted of less serious offenses. Although Republican Gov. Rick Scott rescinded the policy in 2011, these 150,000 ex-felons remain eligible to vote.  
  #While black voters within this population overwhelmingly register with the Democratic Party (87 percent), nonblack voters within this population were more likely to register as Republicans (40 percent) than as a Democrats (34 percent). The fact that 26 percent of the remaining nonblack voters affiliate with neither party suggests that their votes may not reliably be cast for either party.
  # We find that just 16 percent of black and 12 percent of nonblack ex-felons voted. (We defined nonblack as white, Hispanic, Asian, and other due to data limitations.)
